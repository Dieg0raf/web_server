# C++ Web Server

## 🚀 About This Project

I built this web server from scratch as a learning experience to dive deeper into **low-level networking, HTTP protocols, and C++ system programming**. Unlike high-level frameworks, this project allows me to understand **how web servers actually handle requests, manage connections, and optimize performance**.

## 🛠️ Features (Planned)

- Basic request handling (GET, POST, etc.)
- Multi-threaded request processing
- Support for static file serving
- Customizable logging system
- Graceful shutdown handling

## 📌 Progress Tracking

I'll revisit this README to **check off** the topics as I complete them.

## ⚡ Getting Started

To compile and run the server:

```sh
make   # Compile the project
./server  # Start the server
```
